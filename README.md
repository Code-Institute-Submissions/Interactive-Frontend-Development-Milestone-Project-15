Your Project's Name
Travelsome - Holidays

For my milestone 2 project I had devised a website that enabled the user to choose a country from the list, or a location from the search bar. 
When they had selected the country, local tourist hotspots relative to that location would appear. This would allow users to be informed of facilities and events they can 
attend while on holiday at this place.
By giving numerous examples of 'sponsored' countries below the map, the user will find a variety of places to discover using the map above.
The idea was to have a viewport for the location the user has in mind (map), a suggestion section (various countries listed below, with image and hyperlink contained within), 
and a redirect to external third party package holiday supplier.

UX
This website was designed for holiday goer's who were open to suggestion to where they would like to go.
The buttons in the country image below the map allowed the map to redirect to that location, and bring up local amenities of interest.
The Map also featured an autocomplete search box which allowed users to access locations outside of the suggested countries pictured below the map.

As a user I want to access a Holiday website that can show me the location I am interested in on a map. 
This website will highlight all relevant amenities that are relative to me and my holiday choice.
The website will be easy to use, easy to navigate and will be a benefit to the users knowledge of potential holiday locations.

Features
My wepage will consist of a top navbar, a search bar contained in here.
As a landing page, the Map and Jumbotron related to the website brand will appear first.
Below the map, there will be numerous buttons sat atop picture/hyperlink buttons.
The buttons will redirect the map to a city in the named country.
The image/hyperlink below will redirect the user to third party package holiday company.

Features Left to Implement
Unfortunatly, I found my skill and understanding of Javascript to be very limited. 
Despite time dedicated to increasing my knowledge, I find myself still unable to tie it all together and make it an affective part of my website.



In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
For this project I utilized HTML, CSS, Javscript, JQUERY and alot from https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.





# Code Institute

Welcome DavW,

We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started.

To run a frontend application in GitPod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Expose*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Expose*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons. 

Happy coding!
